So now we have 2 functions from the previous task - add and subtract.
Let's tell the machine to decide which to run depending on the
arithmetical operator (+,-,/, * etc).
If the operator is '+', we should use the add function,
else we should use the subtract function.
Step 1 - Create a variable called operator and let it be equal to '+'.
Step 2 - Create 2 variables with any 2 numbers.
Step 3 - Create an if/else statement based on what operator we have.
If we have an operator equal to '+', we call the add function with our numbers,
else we call the subtract function with our numbers.
Don't forget to console.log it to see the result.

A murder mystery is a game typically played at parties wherein one of the partygoersis secretly, and unknowingly, playing a murderer,
and the other attendees must determine who among them is the criminal.
Since this might be your first time playing a murder mystery, we've simplified things quite a bit to make it easier.
Here's what we know! In this murder mystery there are:
* four rooms: the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining room,
* four weapons: poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,
* four suspects: Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.
We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...
* the poison belongs to the ballroom,
* the trophy belongs to the gallery,
* the pool stick belongs to the billiards room,
* and the knife belongs to the dining room.
And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.
Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.
To help solve this mystery, write a combination of conditional statements that:
sets the value of weapon based on the room and
sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room
your function should take a room name and a suspect and 
return the following outputs:
murder("gallery", "Ms. Van Cleve") => "Ms. Van Cleve did it in the gallery with the trophy!"
murder("ballroom", "Ms. Van Cleve") => "There is no way Ms. Van Cleve did it!"
*/

function murder(room, name) {
  // TODO: your work goes here
